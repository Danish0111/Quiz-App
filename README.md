# Quiz Application

A dynamic quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions and view their results with feedback on whether they win or lose.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Users can answer multiple-choice questions.
- **Answer Validation**: The application checks whether the selected answer is correct and displays the result.
- **Results Page**: Displays the total number of correct answers and whether the user wins or loses.
- **Audio Feedback**: Plays a sound when the user wins or loses the quiz.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across devices with a responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different components (Quiz and Results).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **Audio**: Used for sound effects when the user wins or loses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

## How It Works

1. **Home Page**: The user begins the quiz by answering a set of multiple-choice questions.
2. **Quiz Page**: The user selects an answer for each question. The answers are checked, and feedback is provided. The user can proceed to the next question by clicking the "Next" button.
3. **Results Page**: After the last question, the user is shown how many correct answers they got and whether they won or lost the quiz. Audio feedback is provided based on the result.
